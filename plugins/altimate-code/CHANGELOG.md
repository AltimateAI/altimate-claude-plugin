All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- Initial release of the `altimate-code` plugin.
- Delegation skill (`skills/altimate-code/SKILL.md`) that routes dbt and warehouse tasks to the [altimate-code](https://github.com/AltimateAI/altimate-code) CLI agent instead of Claude's native tools.
- SessionStart hook (`hooks/hooks.json`) that describes the plugin's capabilities in the system prompt so Claude can route to it when the task shape fits.
- `/altimate` slash command (`commands/altimate.md`) for explicit delegation with agent-persona selection (`fast-edit` / `analyst` / `builder`).
- `defaultEnabled: false` — the plugin installs disabled and must be enabled explicitly, since it forwards prompts to an external LLM.
